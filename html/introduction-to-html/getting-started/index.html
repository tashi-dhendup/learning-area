        <h1>My first page - HTML</h1>
        <p>
            HTML, or <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, is a standard markup language used to create and structure content for the web.
            It provides a set of tags that are used to define the structure and appearance of web pages, including headings,
            paragraphs, lists, images, and hyperlinks.
        </p>

        <p>
            HTML documents are made up of a series of elements, each consisting of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
            The opening tag tells the browser what type of element it is, while the closing tag indicates the end of the element.
            Elements can also contain attributes, which provide additional information about the element.

            HTML is a key technology used in web development and is often used in conjunction with other technologies such
            as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
            The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which includes many new features such as improved support for multimedia
            content and better accessibility features. For more info, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" title="Intro to Html" target="_blank">visit this link.</a>
